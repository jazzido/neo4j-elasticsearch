== Neo4j Elastic{Search} Integration

[WARNING]
*This is still work in progress. Not tested yet.*

Integrates Neo4j change-feed with an ElasticSearch cluster.

=== Approach

This Neo4j Kernel Extension updates an ElasticSearch instance or cluster with changes in the graph.

A transaction event listener checks changed Nodes against a given label, renders the whole node as json document and indexes all changes in bulk with ES.

[NOTE]
For the test to work, an elastic{search} server should be running on localhost:9200

=== Configuration

Add to `conf/neo4j.properties`:

----
elasticsearch.host_name=http://localhost:9200
elasticsearch.index_spec=my_index:Label(prop1,prop2), my_other_index:OtherLabel(prop3)
----


=== Todo

* Support indexing of relationships?
