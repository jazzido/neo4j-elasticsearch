== Neo4j Elastic{Search} Integration

[WARNING]
*This is still work in progress. Not tested yet.*

Integrates Neo4j change-feed with an ElasticSearch cluster.

=== Approach

This Neo4j Kernel Extension updates an ElasticSearch instance or cluster with changes in the graph.

A transaction event listener checks changed Nodes against a given label, renders the whole node as json document and indexes all changes in bulk with ES.

[NOTE]
For the test to work, an elastic{search} server should be running on localhost:9200

=== Configuration

Add to `conf/neo4j.properties`:

----
elasticsearch.host_name=http://localhost:9200
# todo will be more complex later
elasticsearch.node_selection=MyLabel
elasticsearch.index_name=my_index
----


=== Todo

* Support set of labels for checking
* Different index name per label
* Set of properties per labels to be sent to ES :Label(+prop2,-prop2)
* idea for syntax `indexName:Label(+prop,-prop)`
